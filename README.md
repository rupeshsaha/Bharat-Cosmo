# Bharat Cosmo: ISRO Rockets and Missions

Welcome to **Bharat Cosmo**, your go-to website for information on Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) rockets and missions. This repository aims to provide detailed insights into the various rockets developed and launched by ISRO, along with information on significant missions.

## Rockets

### GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle)
The GSLV series is designed to launch heavier payloads into geostationary orbits. It has several variants such as GSLV Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III.

### PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle)
The PSLV is ISRO's workhorse, capable of launching satellites into polar orbits. It has been instrumental in numerous missions including India's Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan).

### GSLV Mk III (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III)
The GSLV Mk III is India's heaviest and most powerful rocket, capable of carrying heavier payloads to higher altitudes.

### Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)
SSLV is a small, lightweight rocket designed for launching small satellites into low Earth orbit. It aims to provide cost-effective launch options for smaller payloads.

## Missions

### Chandrayaan
Chandrayaan missions are India's lunar exploration programs. Notable missions include Chandrayaan-1 (2008) and Chandrayaan-2 (2019).

### Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission)
Mangalyaan is India's Mars Orbiter Mission launched in 2013, making India the first Asian country to reach Martian orbit and the fourth space agency globally to do so.

### Astrosat
Astrosat is India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory launched in 2015, aimed at studying celestial sources in different wavelengths simultaneously.
